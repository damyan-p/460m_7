# 460m_7
MIPS microprocessor work. Done in Xilinx Vivado.

Currently, the LUI and JAL functions work properly. The best thing to do to debug it would be to get it to work on the board by fixing the R2 functionality.

Part A has a working code section that pulls the value of REG[1] out of the REG module. We need a version that pulls REG[2] out.
Currently, it doesn't work afaik.

It may be easiest to copy some of Part A's stuff but then map it onto the new switches/buttons. (see lab manual)


If you'd like when I come back from research I think I can debug the rest of the instructions. TBH if the R2 part gets figured out the rest wil go really quickly.
